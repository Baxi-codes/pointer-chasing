Benchmarks written by Jee W. Choi, Marat Dukhan, and Xing Liu.

This is a collection of ubenchmarks that has been optimized for performance for different architectures.

The list of benchmarks are
1) intensity
2) L1 cache
3) L2 cache
4) random access

The list of target systems are

* Not tested properly and may not be included in the final version. 
  This is mainly due to the Windows OpenCL driver not working properly.
