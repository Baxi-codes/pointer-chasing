Benchmarks written by Jee W. Choi and Marat Dukhan.

This is a collection of ubenchmarks that has been optimized for performance for different architectures.

The list of benchmarks are
1) intensity
2) L1 cache
3) L2 cache
4) random access

The list of target systems are
1) CPU (Nehalem) (N/A)
2) CPU (Ivy Bridge) (N/A)
3) GPU (HD4000) (N/A)
4) GPU (Fermi) (intensity,compute,bandwidth)
5) GPU (Kepler) (intensity,compute,bandwidth)
6) ARM (Cortex A9) (N/A)
7) ARM (Cortex A15) (N/A)
8) GPU (Mali T604) (N/A)
9) CPU (AMD) (intensity)
10) GPU (Radeon) (intensity DONE)

To compile the ubenchmarks do the following:
