e.g., ubench-x64 for Intel and AMD x86 CPUs

This suite of benchmarks are for testing the memory system.
It includes the following performance ubenchmarks for x64, ARM and Xeon Phi:
1) Random access benchmark for DRAM 
	a) random pointer-chasing
	b) on-the-fly random index generation
2) Random access benchmark for cache
3) Sequential read ubenchmark for DRAM and cache
4) Semi-sequential read ubenchmark (to minimize prefetching)
5) Atomic update benchmark

* One thing to note is that all these ubenchmarks for a single core only.
In order to fully utilize all the cores on the entire CPU, declare n idential data structures (where n is the number of cores) and use "OpenMP sections" to run the functions simultaneously on differnet cores.
