How to compile:

%========================================
Intensity benchmark
	Single:
		make MAD_PER_ELEMENT=<M> TYPE=0
	Double:
		make MAD_PER_ELEMENT=<M> TYPE=1
%========================================
Cache benchmark

How to execute:
./main


1) For single precision function, the kernel issues  1 MUL followed by 1 
ADD, M times.
However, for double precision function, the kernel issues 1 ADD, 1 MUL, 
then 1 ADD, M times. This is done since the core can't issue 
double-precision MUL back to back.

2) Multicore execution is done using OpenMP.

3) For a given M, the arithmetic intensity of this benchmark is different for single and double.
Single
	intensity = (M * 2 flops) / (4 bytes)
Double
	intensity = (M * 3 flops) / (8 bytes)
