How to compile:

%========================================
Intensity benchmark
	Single:
		make N=<n> PRECISION=sp
	Double:
		make N=<n> PRECISION=dp
%========================================

How to execute:
./benchsp5 240

1) In order to change the input array size, change SIZEPERTHREAD in bench.c
2) In order to get accurate timing and performance information, make sure 
   CPUFREQ in bench.c matches the system's clock.
3) Arithmetic intensity is calculate as (2 * n / sizeof (data type)).
4) Supported N values are 1-20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, ..., 300. 
5) Recommended thread number is 4 * (# compute cores), since it is 4-way 
	 hardware multi-threaded.
6) Make sure libiomp5.so is available on the Phi.
