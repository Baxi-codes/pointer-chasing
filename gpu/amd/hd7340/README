How to compile:

%========================================
This benchmark loads 4 words of data per thread and does 5 MADs.
We do 5 MADs instead of 4 because the HD 7340 uses VLIW5 ISA.
%========================================
Intensity benchmark
	Single:
		make 
%========================================

How to execute:
./clbench <array size N (in M)> <M MADs>
The arithmetic intensity of this benchmark is (5 * 2 * M flops) / (2 * 4 * X bytes), where X is the number of bytes per word. In this case, 4 since HD 7340 only has single-precision units.
