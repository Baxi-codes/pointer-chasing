How to compile:

%========================================
This benchmark loads 4 words of data per thread and does 5 MADs.
We do 5 MADs instead of 4 because the HD 7340 uses VLIW5 ISA.
%========================================
Intensity benchmark
	make clbench
Cache/shared memory benchmark
	make clcache
%========================================

How to execute:
1) Intensity
./clbench <array size N (in M)> <M MADs>
The arithmetic intensity of this benchmark is (5 * 2 * M flops) / (2 * 4 * X bytes), where X is the number of bytes per word. In this case, 4 since HD 7340 only has single-precision units.

2) Cache
./clcache <# threads (in Ks)> <block size> <cache size> <vector size>
a) "# of threads" is in thousands (2^10) and block size is the 
b) "block size" is the localWorkSize
c) "cache size" is the number of elements in the local memory array
	 That is, local array size in Bytes = "cache size" * "vector size" * 
	 sizeof (float)
d) "vector size" is the data type length. If 4, array is that of float4.
