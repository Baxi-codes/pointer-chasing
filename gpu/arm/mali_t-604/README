How to compile:

%========================================
1) First copy the relevant .mk file
	E.g., cp Android.mk.l1 Android.mk to build the L1 cache benchmark
2) Then type ndk-build
%========================================

How to execute:
./cl<cache,bench,random>


1) There are two cache benchmarks: cache.cpp and l1.cpp.
l1.cpp uses the cache, whereas cache.cpp uses local(shared) memory.
You should use l1.cpp for Mali T-604 since it does not have local memory.
